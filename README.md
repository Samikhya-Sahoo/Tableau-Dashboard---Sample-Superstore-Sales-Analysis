# Tableau Dashboard - Sample Superstore Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard project utilizes the Sample Superstore dataset to provide an insightful analysis of sales performance. The dashboard is designed to facilitate interactive data exploration and visual representation of key metrics that drive business decisions.

## Features
The dashboard is divided into two main planes:
- **Left Plane**: Contains the company logo, interaction controls, and filters for year and region.
- **Right Plane**: Displays 6 dynamic visualizations and 3 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards based on selected metrics.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Visualizations adjust based on selected metrics such as sales, profit, and number of orders.
- **Interactive Filters**: Filters for year and region allow users to refine their analysis.
- **KPI Cards**: Displays key performance indicators, including:
  - **Profit Margin**: \( \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Total Sales}} \)
  - **Return Rate**: \( \text{Return Rate} = \frac{\text{Quantity Returned}}{\text{Quantity Ordered}} \)
- **Top 5 Products**: Always displays the top 5 products based on the selected metric.
- **Category Chart Filtering**: Filter action implemented on the category chart to dynamically update other visualizations and KPI cards.
- **Logo Interaction**: Clicking on the logo redirects users to the dashboard published on Tableau Public.
- **Trend Lines**: Average and trend lines displayed where applicable.
